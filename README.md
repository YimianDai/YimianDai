### Hi there, I'm [Yi-Mian Dai (戴一冕 in Chinese)](https://yimiandai.work/)! 👋

I am a PhD student at Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics (NUAA).

🔭 **Reseach-wise, I mainly focus on**:

- Small Object Detection
- Neural Architecture Design

😄 **I am open to**:

- collaboration opportunities (anytime & anywhere & any type)
- postdoc position, research internships, or visiting scholar
